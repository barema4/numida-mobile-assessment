### How can one run this app

* Clone repository ```https://github.com/barema4/numida-mobile-assessment ```
* Cd into ```numida-mobile``` sub-folder
* Run the `yarn or npm install` in the terminal  to install the  project dependencies
* Start the app by running
    ```bash
    npx expo start or npm start
     ```

* I have deployed the backend server on ```render.com``` so no need to run it locally


###  A brief description of My approach
*  I have leveraged  React Nativeâ€™s component-based architecture to build reusable UI components that ensure consistency across the application.

* I have followed  best practices like using TypeScript for type safety, Redux for state management, and React hooks for managing  state logic.

* For testing , I have used  React Native Testing Library and Jest, ensuring that components and logic are robust and reliable

*  I have deployed the backend on render.com to ensure smooth running of the application with out setting up the server
